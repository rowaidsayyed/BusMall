# BusMall

In Bus Mall i used constructor function to make objects for the images then i used function to get random number for the images.

I used form to enter the number of images and the number of rounds want to be played
also i used charts to display the results for the number of views and clicks for every image 
final thing i used in this project was local storage i used it to save and load data from local storage so number of views will be added not reset to zero every time we reload the page.
